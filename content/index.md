title: Welcome to My Second Brain
---

My name is **Rajiv**, a **tech founder** and **undergrad engineer**.  
This space is my **"second brain,"** where I can dump all my thoughts—  
from _**random ideas**_ to _**career choices**_, _**daily challenges**_,  
and even my regular _**X-Posts**_.

Currently, only a few folders are publicly viewable, but I may add more later.  
If you'd like to connect with me, check out my [**Linktree Clone**](#).
